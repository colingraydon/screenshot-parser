# screenshot-parser

This app is intended to be a tool for players of the game Dota2. There is an in-game timer and it can be important to remember exact times in game. 

Instead of leaving it to memory, this app has a GUI which will allow the user to screenshot the timer, run optical character recognition, and then show the output on a gui.

While this program supports multiple monitors, it will only currently work if Dota2.exe is shown on the primary monitor.
